# Project Documentation: Interactive Exoplanet

## Project Description

This project is an interactive website that educates users about exoplanets. It provides a clear explanation of what exoplanets are, presents a specific example, and offers users the opportunity to create their own exoplanet. Users can choose characteristics such as mass, radius, and the star their exoplanet will orbit. After creation, the site compares the user's exoplanet with existing real exoplanets and returns the one that is most similar.

## Site Structure

1. **Introduction to Exoplanets**
   - An explanatory section about what exoplanets are.
   - Definition and general characteristics.

2. **Example of an Exoplanet**
   - An example of a real exoplanet.
   - Information about its characteristics (mass, radius, star it orbits, etc.).

3. **Creating the Exoplanet**
   - A form for users to input the characteristics of their exoplanet:
     - Mass
     - Radius
     - Star it orbits
   - Button to submit the information.

4. **Comparison with Real Exoplanets**
   - An algorithm that compares the characteristics of the user's created exoplanet with a database of known exoplanets.
   - Results of the comparison displayed to the user, showing the most similar real exoplanet.
